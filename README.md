CS290 Assignment 1

This will be a website about the french game Tarot. For assignment 1,. The goal would be to add to this website for subsequent assignments and create an actual working game in the browser if any future assignments could fit that in the criteria.

I will create a landing page and a rules page. The landing page will be quite simple with just a picture and links to the rules page. The rules page will go over basic rules and use many of the basic html elements that we learned in the first class. The main colour theme will be probably dark blue on a very very light blue.
