    <h1>Jeu de Tarot</h1>
    
    <h2>The game is under development. Please take a look at this wonderful video in the mean time</h2>
    <!--Will probably make the game as part of future assignments if it fits the critia-->

    <!--I could not figure out how to get the video to play embeded. So it just ends up being basically a link to youtube.
        Some comments online say it might be because of permmissions set by the youtuber and others say it might be because the website you embed it into needs to use https-->
