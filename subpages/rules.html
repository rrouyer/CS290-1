            For each round, the players each play 1 card face up and they go in order, counter-clockwise.<br>
            Every player must play the suit that started the round if they can. If they do not have the requested suit, they must play an Atout if they can.<br>
            If a player plays an Atout, they must play an Atout higher than any other Atout played in that round, if possible. <br>
            If the player does not have the requested suit or atouts, then they may play anything.<br>
            The excuse may be played anytime.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            If an atout is played(besides excuse) the highest atout wins the round and the winner takes all the cards in the round into their win pile (face down).<br>
            If an atout is not played, the highest card in the suit that was requested (first suit played in the round) wins.<br>
            If an excuse is played. The excuse is given back to the person who played it to put in their win pile, regardless of who won the round.<br>
            The player who won the round starts the next round.<br>
            Play till all cards have been played.
